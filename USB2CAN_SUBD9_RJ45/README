This is a very simple interface to connect the 8devices USB2CAN interface to a CAN bus via a dual RJ45 connector.

On one side is a four pin connector t solder a DB9 cable, the other side has the dual RJ45 connector.

CAN bus terminator is not included, this interface can be placed anywhere on the bus.
